# Introduction

## What happens when a request comes in?

A request comes in.

We load the necessary controller that corresponds to that URI.

A controller receives a request and returns a response. 
It delegates to load all the necessary information.

The view is what the user sees.
It receives the data from the controller and generates the HTML.

## Why Do We Use Tools?

We learn tools because they help us accomplish something, or solve a problem that we currently have.
